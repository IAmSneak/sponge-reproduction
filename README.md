They've always said "the devil is in the details" or "god is in the details" but little do
they know that *I* am in the details.

I believe what makes a game great is those tiny things to make life just slightly nicer or
those things that happen very rarely that just make you feel good when you find them,
so this mod does just that. Also has some small tweaks that I needed in my server.

Everything should be configurable in a config by release.
