Sponges are the greatest animals. But in minecraft they are a bit lackluster. They have the potential to be lively beautiful beings that you look at and say "wow, thats really a sponge, innit!" And now that potential is realized. Sponges will now reproduce in the water all on their own, sink, and even walk around! Wet sponges are the only ones affected and only when next to water, so don't worry about your wet sponge houses, they will be unaffected. Oh yeah, if you stand on one underwater it will eat you.
